## Dynamic Parameter Estimation and Tuning (DPET)
 
One of the challenges of power system analysis is to obtain accurate and reliable models of the system components and devices. Manual tuning of model parameters can be time-consuming and prone to errors. ETAP 12.5 introduces a new feature called Dynamic Parameter Estimation and Tuning (DPET) that can automatically tune a model with multiple inputs and outputs using a multi-objective stochastic optimization method. DPET can estimate and adjust parameters such as generator inertia, exciter gain, governor droop, transformer tap position, load characteristics, and more. DPET can also compare the simulated results with measured data from field tests or real-time operation to validate the accuracy of the model.
 
## GOST Short Circuit - R 52735 Standard
 
ETAP 12.5 supports the calculation of short circuit currents according to the GOST R 52735 standard, which is widely used in Russia and other countries. This standard covers both symmetrical and asymmetrical faults for three-phase and single-phase systems. It also considers various factors such as initial symmetrical current, peak current, breaking current, steady-state current, X/R ratio, network configuration, transformer connections, and more. ETAP 12.5 allows users to perform GOST short circuit analysis using an intuitive graphical interface and generate detailed reports with graphical plots.
 
## New Web Consoles for Monitoring and Predictive Simulation
 
ETAP 12.5 enhances its real-time power management system with new web consoles that provide users with access to monitoring and predictive simulation capabilities from any location. Users can view real-time data from SCADA devices such as meters, relays, breakers, switches, etc., as well as perform what-if scenarios using Faster than Real-Timeâ¢ simulation technology. Users can also customize the web console templates to suit their preferences and needs. The web consoles are compatible with various browsers and devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
 
## Native SCADA Communication Protocols
 
ETAP 12.5 offers direct native communication connectivity with various SCADA protocols such as ModbusÂ® RTU, DNP3, OPC, OPC-UA, and IEC 61850. This eliminates the need for intermediate servers or converters and simplifies the configuration and integration of ETAP with SCADA systems. Users can easily map the SCADA data points to the ETAP model elements using drag-and-drop functionality. ETAP 12.5 also supports waveform capturing and synchrophasor measurements from SCADA devices for enhanced situational awareness and analysis.
 
## Enhanced Analysis Modules
 
ETAP 12.5 improves its existing analysis modules with new features and enhancements such as:
 
- Arc Flash Analysis: Users can perform arc flash hazard assessment according to IEEE 1584-2018 standard with updated equations and enclosure types. Users can also generate arc flash labels with QR codes for easy scanning and access to detailed reports.
- Motor Starting Analysis: Users can analyze the start time of motors using various methods such as static (voltage drop), dynamic (torque-speed), or transient (detailed). Users can also consider different types of loads such as constant torque, constant power, quadratic torque, etc.
- DC Short Circuit Analysis: Users can calculate the fault currents in DC systems using ANSI/IEEE or IEC standards. Users can also consider various factors such as battery discharge curves, converter characteristics, cable resistances, etc.
- Cable Amp
