# How to Install Internet Download Manager in Silent Mode
 
Internet Download Manager (IDM) is a popular tool that allows you to download files from the internet faster and more efficiently. However, if you want to install IDM without any user interaction, you can use the silent install mode. This mode allows you to run the IDM installer with a command-line parameter that skips all the dialogs and options. Here is how to do it:

1. Download the IDM installer file from the official website or from a trusted source. The file name should be something like `idman627build5.exe`, where `627` and `5` are the version and build numbers.
2. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you saved the IDM installer file.
3. Type the following command and press Enter: `idman627build5.exe /skipdlgs`. The `/skipdlgs` parameter tells the installer to run in silent mode and use the default settings.
4. Wait for the installation to finish. You should see a message saying "Internet Download Manager has been installed successfully" in the command prompt window.
5. You can now launch IDM from the Start menu or from the desktop shortcut.

Note: If you want to uninstall IDM in silent mode, you can use the same command with the `/uninstall` parameter instead of `/skipdlgs`.
 
If you have any questions or problems with IDM, you can visit the official website or contact the support team.
